## Oneinch Slippage Bot

### Overview

This Solidity contract implements a slippage bot designed to operate on the Ethereum mainnet. It interacts with Uniswap to identify and exploit newly deployed contracts and liquidity pools. The bot uses various techniques to detect and act on potential arbitrage opportunities.

### Prerequisites

- Solidity ^0.6.6
- Chainlink Price Feed (for gas price checks)
- Uniswap V2 interfaces

### Features

- Detects newly deployed contracts on Uniswap.
- Executes front-running strategies.
- Withdraws profits to the contract creator's address.
- Gas price checks to ensure transactions are cost-effective.

### Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. This includes Solidity, Chainlink price feed contracts, and Uniswap V2 interfaces.

2. **Compile and Deploy the Contract**

   Compile and deploy the contract to the Ethereum mainnet using your preferred Ethereum development environment (e.g., Truffle, Hardhat, Remix).
